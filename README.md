Education is very important issue regarding development of a country. The main objective of educational institutions is to provide high quality education to its students. One way to accomplish this is by predicting student's academic performance and thereby taking early steps to improve student's performance and teaching quality.

This system aims to predict student's marks using linear regression. The idea behind this analysis is to predict the marks of students by their studying hours.Through this project we can determine:

How many hours need to do the study to get 99% marks
If I will do study x() hours per day so how much marks I will get
Through these points the school can determine the performance of the student.
